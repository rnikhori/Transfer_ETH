Problem statement :-
You need to create and deploy 4 contracts let's say A, B, C, and D(you can choose any relevant name).
You call a method in contractA which sends ETH to contractB and ContractB forwards the eth to contractC
You call a method in contractA with some ETH which sends the recieved ETH to contractD and contractD rejects the transaction
